# Spectral Analysis of a Flapping Mechanism

This project analyzes the natural resonance frequencies of a simplified mechanical model inspired by insect flight. Using high-speed video footage of a 3D-printed "flapper" device, we extract and analyze wing motion through image processing and frequency-domain signal analysis in MATLAB.

## 🪰 Background

Flying insects flap their wings using a complex system of muscles and elastic thoracic structures. This project focuses on a simplified analog: a mechanical flapper with two wings driven by an electromagnetic actuator.

We excite the system into free oscillation and analyze the motion to determine its natural modes and resonance frequencies — critical parameters in both mechanical design and bio-inspired robotics.

## 🎯 Project Goals

1. **Track wing angles** from high-speed video using image segmentation.
2. **Extract time-series data** representing left/right wing angles.
3. **Compute symmetric and anti-symmetric motion modes**.
4. **Perform spectral analysis** to identify resonance frequencies.
5. **Visualize and interpret** the physical behavior of the flapping system.

## 🚀 How to Run

Make sure you have MATLAB installed.

```matlab
filename = 'Flapper_2_wings.mp4';  % or synthetic equivalent
Fs = 5000;                         % Frame rate in Hz

[thetas, freq, spectra, figs] = video_analyzer(filename, Fs);
